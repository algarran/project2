NJS Roofing Contractors
<br>
We’ve created a functional Commercial Roofing repair business website, with a database to login new clients as well as keeping track of existing clients. This will help the contractor to log new jobs, what was quoted and to keep track of where the job is located. 
<br>
With the ability to provide the client a quote and a printout of the time, price and ariel picture of their building.

Concept:
To provide a website for roofing contractors to use as a tool for quotes and to keep track of locations and customers
<br>
Build a Database to hold all past clients information and follow up needs, ultimately allowing the contractor to update or delete
<br>
Adding a new client will add them to the database with the capability of adding a “follow-up” reminder alert
<br>
After the contractor sets up the new client and an estimate of needs, the site will generate a page for printing, or to save as a PDF
